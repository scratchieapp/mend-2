# Database Migration Instructions

## Important: Use the Corrected Migration

‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT RUN**: `20240101000000_incident_documents.sql` (has errors)
‚úÖ **RUN THIS**: `20240101000001_incident_documents_fixed.sql`

## Issues Fixed in the New Migration

### 1. UUID vs Integer Type Mismatch
- **Problem**: The original migration used INTEGER for `uploaded_by`, but Supabase Auth uses UUID for user IDs
- **Solution**: Changed `uploaded_by` to UUID type to match `users.user_id`

### 2. Auth System Compatibility
- **Problem**: Incorrect casting of `auth.uid()::INTEGER` 
- **Solution**: Removed all INTEGER casting since `auth.uid()` returns UUID

### 3. Added Notifications Table
- **Problem**: Notification system referenced a table that didn't exist
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive notifications table with proper structure

## How to Run the Migration

1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy the contents of `/supabase/migrations/20240101000001_incident_documents_fixed.sql`
4. Paste and execute in SQL Editor
5. Verify tables are created:
   - `incident_documents`
   - `notifications`

## What the Migration Creates

### incident_documents table
- Stores file references for incident documentation
- Links to Supabase Storage
- Tracks who uploaded files and when
- Foreign keys to incidents and users tables

### notifications table  
- Stores notification records
- Supports different notification types (info, warning, error, success)
- JSONB metadata for flexible data storage
- Read/unread status tracking

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can view documents for incidents they have access to
- Authenticated users can upload documents
- Users can update their own documents
- Admins can delete any documents
- Users can only see their own notifications

## Storage Setup

After running the migration, also set up Supabase Storage:

1. Navigate to `/admin/storage-setup` in your application
2. Click "Setup Storage Buckets" 
3. Configure storage policies in Supabase Dashboard:
   - Go to Storage ‚Üí Policies
   - Select "incident-documents" bucket
   - Add appropriate access policies

## Verification

Run these queries to verify the migration succeeded:

```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('incident_documents', 'notifications');

-- Check foreign keys
SELECT
    tc.constraint_name, 
    tc.table_name, 
    kcu.column_name, 
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name 
FROM 
    information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
    JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
      ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
      AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
    JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
      ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
      AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' 
AND tc.table_name IN ('incident_documents', 'notifications');

-- Check RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('incident_documents', 'notifications');
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "relation already exists"
**Solution**: The migration includes DROP TABLE IF EXISTS, but if you need to reset:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.incident_documents CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.notifications CASCADE;
```
Then run the migration again.

### Issue: "permission denied"
**Solution**: Make sure you're running the migration as a database admin user.

### Issue: Storage bucket not accessible
**Solution**: 
1. Create the bucket manually in Supabase Storage
2. Set it to private (not public)
3. Configure RLS policies for the bucket

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Run the corrected migration
2. ‚úÖ Set up storage buckets
3. ‚úÖ Test file uploads in the incident report form
4. ‚úÖ Verify notifications are being created
5. üîÑ Configure email service for actual notification delivery (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
