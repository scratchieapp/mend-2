# Final Fix: Dashboard Performance & Employer Selection

## Two Issues Identified

### 1. Employer Selection Not Working
The shadcn/ui Select component isn't triggering onChange events. This is why selecting an employer is being "ignored".

**Fix Applied**: Using native HTML select temporarily to ensure functionality.

### 2. Slow 700ms+ Queries
The network shows these slow queries:
- `users?select=role...&email=eq.role1@scratchie.com` (710ms)
- `employers?select=employer_id,employer_name` (678ms)

These are being called from multiple places and slowing initial load.

## Immediate Actions

### Just Applied: Working Employer Selector
- Switched to a native HTML select that actually works
- Maintains all functionality with better browser compatibility
- Should allow employer selection to work properly

### After Vercel Deploys (2-5 minutes)

1. **Hard refresh** (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Try selecting an employer** - should work now!
3. **Check network tab** - should see `set_employer_context` calls

## The 8-Second Load Time

This is coming from:
1. Multiple 700ms queries for user/employer data
2. These are likely from:
   - Auth context loading user data
   - Multiple components fetching same data
   - No caching between components

## Quick Performance Win

Try this after deployment:
```javascript
// Warm up the cache by staying on the page
// The second load should be much faster due to React Query caching
```

## Expected Results

✅ Employer selection should work  
✅ Dashboard loads with all data for super admin  
✅ Can switch to specific employers  
⚠️ Initial load still ~8 seconds (needs further optimization)

## Next Steps for Sub-Second Performance

1. Combine all user/employer queries into one
2. Use React Query's shared caching better
3. Consider server-side rendering for initial data
4. Implement data prefetching

But first, let's make sure employer selection works!
