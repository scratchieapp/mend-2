# Mend Platform - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of three critical features for the Mend platform:
1. Worker Portal for role_id 9 (Public/Worker users)
2. Shared Authentication between marketing and operations apps
3. Google Analytics 4 tracking for conversion monitoring

## 1. Worker Portal Implementation

### Files Created/Modified
- **Created:** `/apps/operations/src/pages/WorkerPortal.tsx`
  - Comprehensive dashboard for workers to view their incident history
  - Displays claim status, return-to-work dates, and medical appointments
  - Mobile-responsive design with tabs for Overview, Active Claims, and History
  
- **Modified:** `/apps/operations/src/App.tsx`
  - Added Worker Portal route at `/worker-portal`
  
- **Modified:** `/apps/operations/src/components/auth/DashboardRouter.tsx`
  - Added routing logic for public and client roles to Worker Portal
  
- **Modified:** `/apps/operations/src/lib/auth/roles.ts`
  - Added `isWorker()` helper function for role checking

### Features Implemented
- **Incident History View:** Workers can see all their reported incidents
- **Claim Status Tracking:** Real-time status of workers' compensation claims
- **Return-to-Work Information:** Displays expected return dates and medical appointments
- **Mobile-Friendly Interface:** Fully responsive design for field workers
- **Role-Based Access:** Automatic routing based on user role (public/client roles)

### Database Integration
The Worker Portal queries the following tables:
- `workers` - Worker personal information
- `incidents` - Incident reports linked to workers
- `sites` - Site information for incidents
- `employers` - Employer information

## 2. Shared Authentication (SSO) Implementation

### Files Created/Modified
- **Created:** `/apps/marketing/src/lib/clerk/ClerkProvider.tsx`
  - Clerk authentication provider for marketing app
  - Shared configuration with operations app

  - Shows personalized content for logged-in users

### Features Implemented
- **Single Sign-On:** Users authenticated in operations remain logged in on marketing site
- **Personalized Navigation:** Marketing site shows user menu when authenticated
- **Seamless Navigation:** Direct links between marketing and operations apps
- **Shared Session:** Both apps use the same Clerk authentication instance

### Configuration Required
Both apps need the same `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in their `.env` files

- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness on phone/tablet
- [ ] Check empty states (no incidents, no active claims)
- [ ] Test navigation between tabs (Overview, Active, History)

### Shared Authentication Testing
- [ ] Login to operations app

- [ ] Click user menu - verify user details display
- [ ] Test "Go to Dashboard" link from marketing site
- [ ] Sign out from marketing site - verify both apps logged out
- [ ] Login from marketing site - verify redirect to operations

## Deployment Considerations

### Production URLs
Update environment variables with production URLs:
- Operations: `https://operations.mend.com.au`
- Marketing: `https://mend.com.au`

### Security
- Ensure Clerk production keys are used
- Configure CORS for cross-domain authentication
- Set up proper SSL certificates

### Analytics
- Create separate GA4 properties for staging/production
- Set up conversion goals in GA4 interface
- Configure custom dimensions for user roles

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Configure environment variables
2. Test all three features together
3. Fix any integration issues

### Short Term
1. Add actual demo booking functionality
2. Implement email notifications for workers
3. Add file upload for incident documentation

### Long Term
1. Implement real-time claim status updates
2. Add push notifications for mobile users
3. Create analytics dashboard for business metrics
