# üö® URGENT: Fix Clerk Loading Error on MendPlatform.au

## ‚ùå The Problem

Clerk is failing to load because it's trying to reach:
```
https://clerk.mendplatform.au
```
**This subdomain doesn't exist!**

## ‚úÖ The Solution

### Option 1: Remove Custom Domain from Clerk (FASTEST FIX - 2 minutes)

1. **Go to Clerk Dashboard**: https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. **Select your production application**
3. **Go to**: Domains
4. **REMOVE** the custom domain configuration for `mendplatform.au`
5. **Keep using Clerk's default domain** (e.g., `your-app.clerk.accounts.dev`)

### Option 2: Set up Custom Subdomain (10-15 minutes)

If you want to use `clerk.mendplatform.au`:

1. **Add DNS Record** in your domain provider:
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: clerk
   Value: [Get this from Clerk Dashboard > Domains]
   ```

2. **Verify in Clerk Dashboard**:
   - Go to Domains section
   - Complete the verification process
   - Wait for DNS propagation (5-10 minutes)

## üîß Immediate Actions Required

### Step 1: Fix Clerk Domain Configuration

**In Clerk Dashboard > Domains:**
- Either REMOVE custom domain entirely (recommended for now)
- OR properly configure DNS for `clerk.mendplatform.au`

### Step 2: Update Clerk URLs

**In Clerk Dashboard > Paths:**
- **Home URL**: `https://mendplatform.au`
- **Sign-in URL**: `/auth/clerk-login`
- **After sign-in URL**: `/`

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variables in Vercel

Go to: https://vercel.com/jameskells-projects/mend-2/settings/environment-variables

Make sure you have:
```
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_[your_production_key]
```
NOT the test key!

### Step 4: Redeploy

After fixing the domain configuration:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
3. Wait for deployment to complete

## üéØ Expected Result After Fix

When you visit https://mendplatform.au:
1. ‚úÖ No more "Failed to load Clerk" error
2. ‚úÖ Clerk loads from correct domain
3. ‚úÖ Login page appears
4. ‚úÖ Authentication works

## üîç How to Verify It's Fixed

Open browser console at https://mendplatform.au and check:
1. No errors about `clerk.mendplatform.au`
2. Network tab shows Clerk loading from correct domain
3. You see the login form, not a white screen

## ‚ö° Quick Fix Summary

**The fastest fix**: Remove custom domain from Clerk Dashboard and use their default domain. You can add custom domain later when DNS is properly configured.

**Why this happened**: When you add a custom domain to Clerk, it expects a subdomain (clerk.yourdomain.com) to be configured with proper DNS records. Without this, Clerk can't load.
