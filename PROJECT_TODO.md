## üîÑ IN PROGRESS TASKS

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test Super Admin (role1@scratchie.com) can see ALL incidents
- [ ] Test "View All Companies" dropdown functionality
- [ ] Test Builder Admin (role5@scratchie.com) data isolation
- [ ] Verify no data leaks between companies
- [ ] Test all 9 user roles for proper access control
- [ ] Verify data isolation between companies
- [ ] Complete RBAC_TEST_CHECKLIST.md validation

---

## üìã PENDING TASKS

### Immediate Priority
- [ ] Validate test results from RBAC implementation
- [ ] Fix any issues discovered during testing
- [ ] Document test results in RBAC_TEST_CHECKLIST.md

### Code Cleanup
- [ ] Remove deprecated RLS migration files (archived_*.sql.bak files)
- [ ] Clean up old temporary fix files (FIX_*.md files that are no longer needed)
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate employer selection components
- [ ] Remove console.log statements added for debugging

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add indexes for employer_id filtering if needed
- [ ] Optimize get_incidents_with_details_rbac for large datasets
- [ ] Implement query result caching strategy

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Add audit logging for data access
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- [ ] Add monitoring for unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Create security dashboard for Super Admins

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Implement true RLS when Clerk-Supabase integration improves
- [ ] Add real-time subscriptions with role-based filtering
- [ ] Create role management UI for Super Admins
- [ ] Implement bulk user role assignment features

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Pre-Production
- [x] Database migration applied: `/supabase/migrations/20250827000000_create_rbac_functions.sql`
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Security audit complete
- [ ] Performance benchmarks acceptable
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Production Deployment
- [ ] Backup production database
- [ ] Deploy during low-traffic window
- [ ] Monitor error rates post-deployment
- [ ] Verify all user roles working correctly
- [ ] Update status page if needed

## üìù NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION

### Current State (2025-08-27)
- **Migration Status**: ‚úÖ APPLIED to production
- **Testing Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- **Next Steps**: Awaiting test validation results

### Key Files to Reference
- `/APPLY_RBAC_FIX_NOW.md` - Deployment instructions
- `/RBAC_TEST_CHECKLIST.md` - Testing guide
- `/RLS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Security strategy
- `/supabase/migrations/20250827000000_create_rbac_functions.sql` - Database functions

### Test Accounts
- **Super Admin**: role1@scratchie.com (Password: DemoUser123!)
- **Builder Admin**: role5@scratchie.com (Password: DemoUser123!)
- **Data Entry**: role3@scratchie.com (Password: DemoUser123!)

### Critical Context
1. We're using Clerk for authentication (not Supabase Auth)
2. Implemented hybrid RLS approach using database functions
3. Super Admin should see "View All Companies" dropdown
4. Builder Admin should be restricted to their company only

---

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] Super Admin can view ALL incidents across entire business
- [ ] Super Admin can filter by specific companies
- [ ] Builder Admin sees ONLY their company's incidents
- [ ] No data leaks between companies
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (<2s load times)
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] All user roles function correctly
