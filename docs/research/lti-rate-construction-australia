# what is the industry average LTI rate for the construction industry in Australia? The trend over the past five years

The industry average **Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR)** for the Australian construction sector over the past five years has ranged from approximately **1.3 to 1.6 lost time injuries per million hours worked** for scheme-accredited companies. The most recent available data shows:[^1][^2]

- **2019:** 1.48
- **2020:** 1.48
- **2021:** 1.58
- **2022:** 1.27
- **2023:** 1.50

This LTIFR has remained relatively stable, with a slight dip in 2022 and a minor increase back to 1.50 in 2023. Notably, **commercial construction projects** typically exhibit an LTIFR three times higher than civil construction projects (e.g., 2.66 vs 0.83 in 2023).[^1]

## Five-Year LTIFR Trend in Construction

| Year | LTIFR (Construction, per million hours) |
| :-- | :-- |
| 2019 | 1.48 [^1] |
| 2020 | 1.48 [^1] |
| 2021 | 1.58 [^1] |
| 2022 | 1.27 [^1] |
| 2023 | 1.50 [^1] |

- The average for the broader construction industry (not just scheme-accredited firms) may be somewhat higher, as accredited companies record significantly better safety results than non-accredited counterparts.[^2]
- These rates reflect the general industry and are still commonly referenced, although Safe Work Australia began shifting away from LTIFR as a primary metric in 2025 for a more comprehensive approach to safety benchmarking.[^3]


## Additional Notes

- LTIFR is calculated as (Number of LTIs ÷ Total hours worked) × 1,000,000.[^3]
- Subdivision rates (e.g., Building, Civil, and Services) vary, with heavy and civil engineering sometimes showing higher rates (up to around 13.4 lost-time claims per million hours in WA-specific reports).[^4]

**Summary:** The current industry benchmark for LTIFR in construction is around **1.5 lost time injuries per million hours worked**, with this metric remaining fairly stable over the past five years, and significant variation depending on project type and company accreditation.[^4][^2][^1][^3]
