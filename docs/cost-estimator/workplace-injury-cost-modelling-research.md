# Actuarial Data for Australian Construction Workplace Injury Cost Modelling

Construction companies with $50M–$2B turnover face total injury costs that typically reach **4–7 times** the direct workers' compensation claim amount, with a single Lost Time Injury potentially increasing premiums by **$150,000–$500,000** over three years. This report synthesizes 2024/25 actuarial benchmarks across five critical cost categories for LTI vs MTI scenario modelling in NSW and Victoria.

## Fully-loaded labour hire replacement runs $52–$130 per hour

Replacing an injured worker through labour hire involves substantial costs beyond base wages. For Australian construction in 2024/25, **fully-loaded charge-out rates** (inclusive of agency margins, superannuation, workers' compensation, and payroll tax) are:

| Worker Type | Hourly Charge-Out | Daily (8 hrs) | Weekly (38 hrs) |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **General Labourer** | $52–$60 + GST | $416–$480 | **$1,976–$2,280** |
| **Skilled Trades** (carpenter, electrician, plumber) | $70–$130 + GST | $560–$1,040 | **$2,660–$4,940** |

The underlying cost structure comprises the Fair Work award base rate (CW3 labourer at $28.12/hr casual, CW7 tradesperson at $39.45/hr casual), plus **11.5% superannuation**, **2.6%–14% workers' compensation** depending on trade classification, **5.45% payroll tax** (NSW), and agency margins of **25–40%** on top of all employer costs. Labour hire agencies quote $52/hr for Sydney labourers and $80–$130/hr for licensed electricians and plumbers, reflecting both the skills premium and market demand.

NSW workers' compensation industry rates for 2024/25 illustrate the variance: concrete construction services attract **14.04%**, bricklaying **10.44%**, carpentry **8.78%**, but electrical services only **2.61%**. These rates flow through to labour hire charge-outs.

## The indirect cost multiplier is higher for MTI than LTI

Safe Work Australia's foundational benchmark establishes that for every **$1 in direct costs**, employers face **$5–7 in indirect costs**—the "iceberg model" where visible workers' compensation claims represent only 14–20% of true injury costs.

Counterintuitively, **Medical Treatment Injuries carry higher multipliers than Lost Time Injuries**:

| Injury Category | Multiplier Range | Rationale |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------|
| **First Aid Injury (FAI)** | 5–10× | Minimal direct costs, but full administrative/investigation burden |
| **Medical Treatment Injury (MTI)** | **4–5×** | Low compensation costs, but productivity loss, admin, and investigation still occur |
| **Lost Time Injury – Short (<5 days)** | 2–4× | Direct costs increase, reducing the ratio |
| **Lost Time Injury – Long (5+ days)** | **1.5–3×** | High compensation costs dominate total |
| **Permanent Incapacity** | 1.1–2× | Direct costs overwhelm indirect costs |

This inverse relationship occurs because indirect costs (supervisor time, investigation, productivity disruption, replacement training, project delays) remain relatively constant regardless of injury severity, while direct costs (medical expenses, wage replacement) scale with severity. A Stanford/OSHA construction study quantified this sliding scale: claims under **$3,000 attract a 4.5× multiplier**, while claims over **$10,000 attract only 1.1×**.

For construction-specific cost modelling, Australian university research documents total costs per incident severity: **short absence (<5 days) costs $3,344 total**, long absence (5+ days with full return) costs **$35,638**, partial incapacity costs **$260,672**, and full incapacity costs **$1.69 million**. Production disruption and human capital losses—not medical costs—drive these figures.

## Claims affect NSW and VIC premiums for three years

Both icare (NSW) and WorkSafe Victoria use experience-based rating systems where claims history directly modifies premiums for **medium-to-large employers over a 3-year lookback period**.

### NSW premium calculation mechanics

Employers with Average Performance Premium (APP) above **$30,000** (roughly $600K+ wages at typical construction rates) have premiums adjusted via the Claims Performance Adjustment (CPA). The CPA compares an employer's claims cost ratio against the industry benchmark of approximately 4.3%.

For large employers (APP >$2M), the CPA multiplier ranges from **0.45 (55% discount)** for claims performance under 10% to **1.45 (45% loading)** for claims performance over 1,200% of benchmark. A $50,000 LTI claim for a company with $20M wages would shift their claims performance ratio from 0% to approximately 200–250%, potentially increasing their CPA from 0.625 to 1.1—a **76% increase before the 30% annual cap applies**.

Construction base rates (WIC) for 2024/25 range from **2.61%** (electrical services) to **14.04%** (concrete construction), with house construction at **4.84%** and general construction services at **6.06%**.

### Victoria premium calculation mechanics

WorkSafe Victoria uses Statistical Case Estimation (SCE) to project lifetime claim costs, which means even open claims immediately affect premiums. Employers with remuneration above **$200,000** are experience-rated, with the Performance Rating modifier determined by comparing employer claims experience to industry average.

Construction industry rates in Victoria range from **2.08%** (residential building) to **13.18%** (tiling/carpeting), with concreting at **5.06%** and general construction services at **6.02%**. Victoria's **maximum individual claim cost cap of $479,000** (2024/25) limits exposure from catastrophic claims.

| Factor | NSW (icare) | VIC (WorkSafe) |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Experience period | 3 years | 3 years |
| Annual increase cap | **30%** | **30%** |
| Experience threshold | APP >$30,000 | Remuneration >$200,000 |
| Construction base rates | 2.6%–14.0% | 2.1%–13.2% |

A modelled scenario: a $100M-wage construction company experiencing a $150,000 LTI claim would see premium increases of approximately **$2–2.5 million over three years** (capped at 30% annually), demonstrating why injury prevention delivers substantial ROI.

## Construction injuries average 8.5 weeks lost and $18,500 compensation

Safe Work Australia's Key Work Health and Safety Statistics 2024 establishes construction-specific benchmarks that exceed all-industry averages:

| Metric | Construction | All Industries |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Serious claims frequency | **8.8** per million hours | 6.6 per million hours |
| Median time lost | **8.5 weeks** | 7.4 weeks |
| Median compensation | **$18,500** | $16,300 |
| Share of all serious claims | 12% | — |

The **top 5 injury types** in construction and their modelling parameters:

| Injury Type | % of Claims | Estimated Median Time Lost | Estimated Median Compensation |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Musculoskeletal** (sprains, strains, back) | 35–38% | 7–9 weeks | $15,900–$19,000 |
| **Wounds/Lacerations** | 14–18% | 5–6 weeks | $10,000–$14,000 |
| **Fractures** | 10–15% | 10–12 weeks | $20,000–$25,000 |
| **Contusions/Crushing** | 5–8% | 3–5 weeks | $8,000–$12,000 |
| **Eye Injuries** | 2–4% | 1–3 weeks | $5,000–$10,000 |

Body stressing (manual handling) causes **34.5%** of construction serious claims, followed by falls/slips/trips at **21.8%** and being hit by moving objects at **16%**. The construction frequency rate of 8.8 claims per million hours worked is **33% higher** than the all-industries average.

Critically, claims involving **13+ weeks lost** represent only 21.9% of claim volume but account for **74.8% ($5.4 billion)** of total compensation paid—meaning long-duration LTIs drive the majority of scheme costs.

## Weekly compensation step-downs create predictable cost curves

Both NSW and Victoria use **95% → 80% step-down structures** at week 14, creating predictable cost trajectories for injury duration modelling.

### NSW entitlement structure (Workers Compensation Act 1987)

| Period | Rate (% of PIAWE) | Maximum Weekly (Oct 2024) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Weeks 1–13** | 95% | **$2,523** |
| **Weeks 14–130** | 80% (or 95% if working 15+ hrs/wk) | $2,523 |
| **Weeks 131–260** | 80% (requires no work capacity indefinitely) | $2,523 |
| **Beyond 260 weeks** | Continues only if WPI >20% | $2,523 |

NSW provides a **maximum 260-week (5-year) entitlement** for standard claims, with extended benefits only for workers with permanent impairment exceeding 20%.

### Victoria entitlement structure (WIRC Act 2013)

| Period | Rate (% of PIAWE) | Maximum Weekly (Jul 2024) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Weeks 1–13** | 95% | **$2,800** |
| **Weeks 14–130** | 80% | $2,800 |
| **Beyond 130 weeks** | Requires WPI >20% AND no work capacity indefinitely | $2,800 |

Victoria's March 2024 reforms created a **130-week hard stop** unless workers demonstrate both **>20% Whole Person Impairment** and no work capacity likely to continue indefinitely—significantly reducing long-tail exposure.

For both states, overtime and shift allowances are **excluded from PIAWE after 52 weeks**, creating a secondary step-down for workers whose pre-injury earnings included regular overtime.

## Cost modelling implications for construction businesses

For a target construction company ($50M–$2B turnover) building an injury cost estimation model, the following parameters provide defensible actuarial inputs:

**Direct costs per LTI:**
- Medical and rehabilitation: **$15,000–$25,000** median
- Weekly compensation: **$18,500** median total (8.5 weeks × ~$2,200/week)
- Premium impact over 3 years: **$150,000–$500,000** for mid-size employers

**Indirect costs per LTI:**
- Apply **2× multiplier** to direct costs for serious LTIs
- Apply **4× multiplier** for MTIs and minor injuries

**Labour replacement costs:**
- Budget **$2,000–$2,300/week** for labourer replacement
- Budget **$3,500–$5,000/week** for skilled trade replacement

**Duration assumptions by injury type:**
- Musculoskeletal: 8 weeks
- Fractures: 11 weeks
- Lacerations: 5 weeks
- Contusions: 4 weeks
- Eye injuries: 2 weeks

The model should account for Victoria's higher maximum weekly compensation ($2,800 vs $2,523) but shorter maximum duration (130 vs 260 weeks), making NSW claims potentially more expensive for long-duration injuries while Victoria claims are more expensive in the first 13 weeks.

## Conclusion

This actuarial framework reveals that **true injury costs are 4–7 times workers' compensation claims**, with premium impacts persisting for three years and replacement labour costs of **$2,000–$5,000 weekly** depending on skill level. The counterintuitive finding that MTIs carry higher indirect cost multipliers (4–5×) than LTIs (1.5–3×) should inform prevention prioritization—even "minor" injuries create substantial hidden costs through administrative burden and productivity disruption.

For $50M–$2B construction businesses, a single serious LTI creates total exposure of approximately **$100,000–$300,000** when direct costs, indirect costs, and premium impacts are combined. Victoria's 2024 reforms have reduced long-tail liability exposure significantly, making NSW claims with durations exceeding 130 weeks the primary driver of catastrophic cost scenarios.
