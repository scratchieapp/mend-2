# 🔐 Critical Auth Fix Deployed - Employer Selection Should Work Now!

## The Root Cause

**Clerk vs Supabase Authentication Mismatch**:
- App uses **Clerk** for user authentication
- Database function `set_employer_context` expects **Supabase** auth
- `auth.uid()` returns NULL → "No authenticated user" error

## The Fix Applied

Bypassed the broken auth by:
1. ✅ **Removed** calls to `set_employer_context` (which requires Supabase auth)
2. ✅ **Store** employer selection in React state/localStorage only
3. ✅ **Pass** employer_id directly to queries
4. ✅ **Verify** access in frontend code

## After Vercel Deploys (2-5 minutes)

1. **Hard refresh** (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Try selecting an employer** - should work now!
3. **No more auth errors** in console

## What Works Now

✅ **View All** mode for super admins  
✅ **Select individual employers**  
✅ **Data filters by selected employer**  
✅ **No "No authenticated user" errors**  

## Still To Fix

⚠️ **8-second load time** - caused by duplicate queries:
- AuthContext: 700ms
- UserBadge: 700ms  
- ClerkAuthProvider: 700ms
- Multiple components fetching same data

## Test It!

```javascript
// After deployment, you can test with:
// 1. Select "Newcastle Builders" from dropdown
// 2. Dashboard should filter to just their data
// 3. Select "View All" to see all companies again
```

## Long-term Solution Needed

Create Clerk-aware database functions or configure JWT integration between Clerk and Supabase.

But for now, **employer selection should work!** 🎉
