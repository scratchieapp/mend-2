# IMMEDIATE FIX: Dropdown Not Responding

## The Problem
The dropdown isn't triggering ANY events - no console logs, no updates. This means:
1. The component isn't using the debug version
2. Or there's a React/bundling issue

## Quick Fix Applied
Changed MenuBar to import the debug version directly.

## Test Now
1. **Stop your dev server** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Start it again** (`npm run dev` or similar)
3. **Hard refresh** the browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
4. **Open console** and try selecting an employer

## If Still Not Working

Try this in browser console:
```javascript
// Check if React Select is working
document.querySelectorAll('[role="combobox"]').forEach(el => {
  console.log('Found select:', el);
  el.addEventListener('click', () => console.log('Select clicked!'));
});
```

## Alternative Test
In browser console, type:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem("selectedEmployerId", "8");
location.reload();
```

This will manually set employer 8 (Newcastle Builders). If this works, then the issue is definitely with the Select component event handling.

## Nuclear Option
If nothing else works, we may need to:
1. Replace the custom Select with a native HTML select temporarily
2. Check for React version conflicts
3. Clear all caches and rebuild
