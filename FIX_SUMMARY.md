# Authentication & URL Configuration Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Localhost References Removed
All hardcoded localhost URLs have been replaced with environment-aware configuration that automatically adapts to development and production environments.

### 2. Post-Login Redirect Flow Fixed
Users now go directly to their role-specific dashboard after login, eliminating the need to click "Go to dashboard".

## Changes Made

### New Files Created

#### `/apps/operations/src/lib/config/environment.ts`
- Centralized environment configuration for operations app
- Handles development vs production URL logic
- Provides helper functions for building URLs

### Files Modified

#### Marketing App
1. **`/apps/marketing/src/components/UserMenu.tsx`**
   - Updated to use `getOperationsUrl()` instead of hardcoded localhost
   - Removed direct environment variable access with fallback to localhost

2. **`/apps/marketing/src/lib/clerk/ClerkProvider.tsx`**
   - Updated `openSignIn` function to use `getOperationsUrl()`
   - Removed hardcoded localhost fallback

3. **`/apps/marketing/src/App.tsx`**
   - Updated operations platform redirect to use `getOperationsUrl()`
   - Fixed production note to reference correct domain

4. **`/apps/marketing/.env.local.example`**
   - Updated to show production URLs as default
   - Development URLs now commented out

#### Operations App
1. **`/apps/operations/src/lib/config.ts`**
   - Refactored to re-export from new environment configuration module
   - Maintained backward compatibility

2. **`/apps/operations/src/pages/auth/ClerkLogin.tsx`**
   - Added `afterSignInUrl` property to SignIn component
   - Enhanced redirect logic to ensure immediate dashboard routing
   - Added user check to authentication effect

3. **`/apps/operations/src/components/auth/AuthStateHandler.tsx`**
   - Enhanced auth route detection to include `/sign-in` and `/sign-up`
   - Improved redirect logic for authenticated users

4. **`/apps/operations/.env.local.example`**
   - Updated to show production URLs as default
   - Development URLs now commented out

## Environment Configuration

### Development
```env
# Marketing App
VITE_OPERATIONS_URL=http://localhost:5173/operations
VITE_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:5174

# Operations App
VITE_MARKETING_URL=http://localhost:5174
VITE_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:5173/operations
```

### Production
```env
# Marketing App
VITE_OPERATIONS_URL=https://accounts.mendplatform.au
VITE_PUBLIC_URL=https://mendplatform.au

# Operations App
VITE_MARKETING_URL=https://mendplatform.au
VITE_PUBLIC_URL=https://accounts.mendplatform.au
```

## Authentication Flow

### Before Fix
1. User logs in → Stays on homepage → Must click "Go to dashboard" → Redirected to role dashboard

### After Fix
1. User logs in → Immediately redirected to role-specific dashboard

## How It Works

1. **Environment Detection**: The `getEnvironment()` function checks if the app is in production mode
2. **URL Resolution**: Based on environment, the correct URLs are returned (localhost for dev, mendplatform.au for prod)
3. **Post-Login Redirect**: 
   - Clerk's `afterSignInUrl` property ensures redirect to root (`/`)
   - `AuthStateHandler` detects authenticated user and triggers navigation
   - `DashboardRouter` immediately redirects to role-specific dashboard

## Testing Instructions

### Development Testing
1. Start both apps: `npm run dev`
2. Visit marketing site: http://localhost:5174
3. Click Login
4. Sign in with demo credentials
5. Verify immediate redirect to role dashboard

### Production Testing
1. Deploy with production environment variables
2. Visit https://mendplatform.au
3. Click Login (redirects to https://accounts.mendplatform.au/sign-in)
4. Sign in
5. Verify immediate redirect to role dashboard on accounts.mendplatform.au

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Zero hardcoded localhost URLs in production code
✅ All URLs are environment-aware
✅ Users go directly to dashboard after login
✅ Production deployment uses mendplatform.au everywhere
✅ Development environment still works with localhost
✅ Build completes successfully without errors

## Notes

- The environment configuration automatically detects whether the app is running in production or development mode
- No manual configuration changes needed when deploying to production (beyond setting environment variables)
- The solution maintains backward compatibility with existing code
- All changes are type-safe and follow existing patterns in the codebase
