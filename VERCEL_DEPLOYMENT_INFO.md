# Vercel Deployment Information

## About Production Testing

Since you're testing on production (mendplatform.au) via Vercel deployments:

1. **No need to stop/start dev server** - That's only for local testing
2. **Deployment takes 2-5 minutes** after pushing to GitHub
3. **Browser caching is critical** - Always hard refresh after deployment

## Just Pushed: Clean Production Build

I've removed all debug logging that was spamming the console:
- ✅ Removed "EmployerContextSelector render" logs
- ✅ Reverted from debug Simple selector to original
- ✅ All console.log statements removed

## The Real Fix Already Applied

The actual infinite loop was fixed in the previous commit:
- Changed `useEffect` dependencies to prevent circular updates
- Added `isInitialized` ref to ensure one-time setup
- This was the root cause of performance issues

## After Vercel Deploys (2-5 minutes)

1. **Wait for deployment notification** from Vercel
2. **Clear browser completely**:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear();
   sessionStorage.clear();
   ```
3. **Hard refresh**: Cmd+Shift+R

## Expected Results

- ✅ No more console spam
- ✅ Dashboard loads in < 2 seconds (was 7+ seconds)
- ✅ Employer selection works properly
- ✅ Clean console output

## If Issues Persist

The network tab shows good performance:
- `get_dashboard_data` in 74ms ✅
- Most queries under 200ms ✅

Any remaining slowness might be from:
- Browser cache
- CDN cache
- Vercel build cache

Try incognito mode or different browser to rule out caching.
