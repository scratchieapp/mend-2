# User-Employers Table Solution - Complete Implementation

## Problem Solved

The RBAC functions were failing with:
```
relation "user_employers" does not exist
```

This was because the performance optimization migration referenced a table that hadn't been created yet. The system was trying to check user-employer relationships but had no way to store them.

## Solution Overview

We've created a comprehensive solution that:
1. **Creates the missing `user_employers` table** - A proper many-to-many relationship table
2. **Updates all RBAC functions** - To use the new table for access control
3. **Handles different role scenarios** - MEND staff vs company-specific roles
4. **Provides management functions** - For assigning/removing user-employer relationships

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Role-Based Access Hierarchy

```
MEND Staff (Roles 1-4) → See ALL data (no user_employers entries needed)
├── Super Admin (1)     - Full system access
├── Account Manager (2) - Manages all accounts
├── Data Entry (3)      - Enters data for all companies
└── Analyst (4)         - Analyzes across all companies

Company Roles (5+) → See ONLY assigned employer data (requires user_employers)
├── Builder Admin (5)   - Manages specific company
├── Site Admin (6)      - Manages specific sites
├── Client (7)          - Client access
├── Vendor (8)          - Vendor access
└── Public (9)          - Limited public access
```

### 2. User-Employers Table Structure

```sql
user_employers
├── user_id (UUID)        - Links to users table
├── employer_id (INT)     - Links to employers table
├── is_primary (BOOL)     - Marks primary employer
├── assigned_at (TIMESTAMP)
├── assigned_by (UUID)    - Audit trail
└── notes (TEXT)          - Assignment notes
```

### 3. Access Control Logic

The RBAC functions now follow this logic:
```
IF user_role IN (1,2,3,4) THEN
    → Allow access to ALL data
ELSE IF user_role IN (5,9) THEN
    → Check user_employers table
    → Only allow access to assigned employers
ELSE
    → Default behavior (currently allow all, can be restricted)
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Apply the Migration
```bash
# Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard
# Copy contents of migration file and run in SQL editor

# Option B: Via CLI
cd /Users/jameskell/Cursor/mend-2
supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Verify Table Creation
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_employers;
```

### Step 3: Test Role Access
```sql
-- Test Super Admin (should see all)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM get_incidents_with_details_rbac(
    user_role_id := 1,
    p_user_id := (SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE email = 'role1@scratchie.com')
);

-- Test Builder Admin (should see only assigned employer)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM get_incidents_with_details_rbac(
    user_role_id := 5,
    p_user_id := (SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE email = 'role5@scratchie.com')
);
```

### Step 4: Update Frontend
Update API calls to pass user_id:
```typescript
const { data } = await supabase.rpc('get_incidents_with_details_rbac', {
    user_role_id: currentUser.roleId,
    p_user_id: currentUser.userId, // NEW PARAMETER
    // ... other params
});
```

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. Flexibility
- Users can belong to multiple employers
- Easy to add/remove employer assignments
- Primary employer concept for default views

### 2. Security
- Proper data isolation between companies
- Audit trail for assignments
- Role-based access clearly defined

### 3. Performance
- Indexed lookups for fast access checks
- Array operations for efficient filtering
- Optimized for common queries

### 4. Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Management functions for easy administration
- Comprehensive documentation

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Migration applied successfully
- [ ] user_employers table exists
- [ ] Super Admin (role1) can see ALL incidents
- [ ] Builder Admin (role5) can see ONLY their employer's incidents
- [ ] get_user_employer_ids() returns correct values
- [ ] assign_user_to_employer() works
- [ ] Frontend updated to pass user_id parameter

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Builder Admin sees no data
**Solution**: Ensure they have an entry in user_employers table
```sql
SELECT assign_user_to_employer(
    p_user_id := (SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE email = 'role5@scratchie.com'),
    p_employer_id := 1,
    p_is_primary := true
);
```

### Issue 2: Super Admin sees no data
**Solution**: Check role_id is correct (should be 1)
```sql
UPDATE users SET role_id = 1 WHERE email = 'role1@scratchie.com';
```

### Issue 3: Function not found error
**Solution**: Migration hasn't been applied, run it first

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Apply the migration to fix the broken RBAC
2. **Short-term**: Update frontend to use new p_user_id parameter
3. **Medium-term**: Add UI for managing user-employer assignments
4. **Long-term**: Implement site-level restrictions using similar pattern

## Success Metrics

After successful implementation:
- ✅ No more "relation does not exist" errors
- ✅ Super Admins see all company data
- ✅ Builder Admins see only their company data
- ✅ Multi-employer assignments work correctly
- ✅ Performance remains optimal (<2 seconds load time)

**Status**: Ready for immediate deployment
**Priority**: CRITICAL - System is broken without this fix
**Time to implement**: ~5 minutes to apply migration
**Risk**: LOW - Additive changes only, no data deletion
