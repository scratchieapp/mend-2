# ðŸ”’ Proper RLS Implementation with Clerk Authentication

## Overview
This implementation provides secure Row-Level Security (RLS) that:
- âœ… Works with Clerk authentication (not Supabase Auth)
- âœ… Allows MEND staff (roles 1-3) to see all records
- âœ… Restricts company users (roles 4+) to only their company data
- âœ… Maintains data security and isolation between companies

## How It Works

### Role-Based Access:
- **Roles 1-3 (MEND Staff)**: Super Admin, Account Manager, Data Entry
  - Can see ALL incidents from ALL companies
  - Can filter by specific company or view all
  
- **Roles 4+ (Company Users)**: Builder Admin, Site Admin, Client, Vendor
  - Can ONLY see their own company's incidents
  - Cannot access other companies' data

### Technical Implementation:
1. Frontend passes user's `role_id` and `employer_id` to database functions
2. Database functions set session variables for RLS policies
3. RLS policies check these variables to determine access
4. Queries automatically filter based on user's role and company

## Files Changed

### 1. Database Migration (NEW)
**File**: `/supabase/migrations/20250826_proper_rls_with_clerk.sql`
- Creates RLS policies for all tables
- Updates functions to accept user context parameters
- Enables strict data isolation

### 2. User Context Hook (NEW)
**File**: `/apps/operations/src/hooks/useUserContext.ts`
- Fetches user's role_id and employer_id from database
- Provides context to components
- Determines if user is MEND staff

### 3. Incidents Service (UPDATED)
**File**: `/apps/operations/src/lib/supabase/incidents.ts`
- Added `userRoleId` and `userEmployerId` parameters
- Passes user context to database functions

### 4. IncidentsList Component (UPDATED)
**File**: `/apps/operations/src/components/dashboard/IncidentsList.tsx`
- Uses `useUserContext` hook
- Passes user context when fetching incidents
- Waits for user context before querying

## Apply the Migration

### Step 1: Run the SQL Migration
1. Open your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the entire contents of `/supabase/migrations/20250826_proper_rls_with_clerk.sql`
4. Paste and execute

### Step 2: Verify the Migration
Run this query to check RLS is enabled:
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('incidents', 'workers', 'sites', 'employers');
```
All should show `rowsecurity = true`

### Step 3: Test with Different Users

#### Test as Super Admin (role1@scratchie.com):
1. Log in with role1@scratchie.com
2. Go to dashboard
3. Select a specific builder â†’ Should see only that builder's incidents
4. Select "View All" â†’ Should see ALL incidents

#### Test as Company User (role5@scratchie.com):
1. Log in with role5@scratchie.com (Builder Admin)
2. Go to dashboard
3. Should NOT see employer dropdown (fixed to their company)
4. Should see ONLY their company's incidents
5. Cannot access other companies' data

## How RLS Policies Work

### For Incidents Table:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "incidents_access_policy" ON incidents
  FOR ALL
  USING (
    CASE
      -- MEND staff (roles 1-3) see everything
      WHEN current_setting('app.current_role_id')::INTEGER IN (1, 2, 3) THEN true
      -- Company users see only their company
      WHEN current_setting('app.current_employer_id')::INTEGER = employer_id THEN true
      ELSE false
    END
  );
```

### For Related Tables (workers, sites, etc.):
Same pattern - MEND staff see all, company users see only their data.

## Security Benefits

1. **Data Isolation**: Companies cannot see each other's data
2. **No Bypass**: RLS enforced at database level
3. **Audit Trail**: All access controlled and logged
4. **Scalable**: Works with unlimited companies
5. **Role Flexibility**: Easy to add new roles/permissions

## Troubleshooting

### If incidents don't show after migration:
1. Check user has valid role_id and employer_id in database
2. Verify RLS is enabled on tables
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure frontend is passing user context

### To temporarily debug:
```sql
-- Check what context is being set
SELECT current_setting('app.current_role_id', true) as role,
       current_setting('app.current_employer_id', true) as employer;
```

### To view RLS policies:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('incidents', 'workers', 'sites');
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Cache user context** to reduce database lookups
2. **Add role-based field masking** (hide sensitive fields from certain roles)
3. **Implement audit logging** for compliance
4. **Add cross-company access** for specific scenarios (partnerships, etc.)

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can temporarily disable RLS:
```sql
-- Emergency disable (NOT for production!)
ALTER TABLE incidents DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE workers DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE sites DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE employers DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

Then re-enable after fixing issues:
```sql
ALTER TABLE incidents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- etc...
```
