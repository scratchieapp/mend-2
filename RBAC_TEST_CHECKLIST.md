## üìä Verification Queries

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:

```sql
-- Check total incidents in system
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_system_incidents FROM incidents;

-- Check incidents per employer
SELECT 
  e.employer_name,
  COUNT(i.incident_id) as incident_count
FROM employers e
LEFT JOIN incidents i ON e.employer_id = i.employer_id
GROUP BY e.employer_id, e.employer_name
ORDER BY incident_count DESC;

-- Test Super Admin function (should see all)
SELECT COUNT(*) as super_admin_count
FROM get_incidents_with_details_rbac(
  user_role_id => 1,
  user_employer_id => NULL
);

-- Test Builder Admin function (should see only employer 1)
SELECT COUNT(*) as builder_admin_count
FROM get_incidents_with_details_rbac(
  user_role_id => 5,
  user_employer_id => 1
);
```

## üîç Browser Console Checks

Open browser DevTools and check:

```javascript
// Check current user role
console.log('Role ID:', roleId);
console.log('Employer ID:', employerId);
console.log('Is Super Admin:', roleId === 1);

// Check selected employer context
console.log('Selected Employer:', localStorage.getItem('selectedEmployerId'));
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Super Admin can't see all incidents
- **Check**: Role ID is exactly 1 (not "1" string)
- **Fix**: Clear localStorage and re-login
- **Verify**: Database function exists with `\df *rbac*` in SQL

### Issue: No employer dropdown for Super Admin
- **Check**: User mode is "mend" not "builder"  
- **Fix**: Switch mode using mode selector
- **Verify**: roleId === 1 in browser console

### Issue: Builder Admin sees all companies
- **Check**: Role ID should be 5
- **Fix**: Verify user's role_id in database
- **Query**: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'role5@scratchie.com';`

### Issue: Functions not found error
- **Check**: RBAC functions were created
- **Fix**: Run migration script from /supabase/migrations/
- **Verify**: `SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines WHERE routine_name LIKE '%rbac%';`
