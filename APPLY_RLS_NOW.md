# ðŸš¨ APPLY RLS SOLUTION - STEP BY STEP

## The Problem
You have multiple conflicting versions of database functions causing errors.

## The Solution
Clean everything and apply a single, working version with proper access control.

## Steps to Apply

### 1. Open Supabase Dashboard
Go to your Supabase project â†’ SQL Editor

### 2. Run the Clean & Apply Migration
Copy and paste the ENTIRE contents of:
```
/supabase/migrations/20250826_clean_and_apply_rls.sql
```

Click **RUN**

### 3. Verify It Worked
Run this query to check:
```sql
-- Should return 3 functions
SELECT proname, pronargs as param_count
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname IN (
  'get_incidents_with_details',
  'get_incidents_count', 
  'get_employers_for_user'
);
```

Expected result:
- get_incidents_with_details: 8 parameters
- get_incidents_count: 6 parameters  
- get_employers_for_user: 2 parameters

### 4. Test with Different Users

#### Test Super Admin Access (role1@scratchie.com):
```sql
-- Should see ALL incidents when no filter
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM get_incidents_with_details(
  user_role_id := 1,
  user_employer_id := NULL
);

-- Should see ONLY employer 1 when filtered
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM get_incidents_with_details(
  filter_employer_id := 1,
  user_role_id := 1,
  user_employer_id := NULL
);
```

#### Test Company User Access (role5@scratchie.com):
```sql
-- Should see ONLY their company (employer_id = 1)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM get_incidents_with_details(
  user_role_id := 5,
  user_employer_id := 1
);

-- Cannot see other companies (should return 0)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM get_incidents_with_details(
  filter_employer_id := 2,
  user_role_id := 5,
  user_employer_id := 1
);
```

## How It Works

### Access Rules:
- **Roles 1-3** (MEND Staff): Can see ALL companies or filter by specific company
- **Roles 4+** (Company Users): Can ONLY see their own company's data

### Security:
- No direct table access - everything goes through secure functions
- Role-based filtering enforced in functions
- Company isolation guaranteed

## Testing in the App

1. **Log in as role1@scratchie.com** (Super Admin)
   - Should see employer dropdown
   - Can select any company
   - Sees filtered incidents

2. **Log in as role5@scratchie.com** (Builder Admin) 
   - NO employer dropdown
   - Sees ONLY their company's incidents
   - Cannot access other company data

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Error: "function does not exist"
Run the migration again - it will clean up and recreate everything.

### Error: "permission denied"
Check that the GRANT statements ran:
```sql
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_incidents_with_details TO authenticated, anon;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_incidents_count TO authenticated, anon;
```

### No incidents showing
Check the user's role_id and employer_id:
```sql
SELECT email, role_id, employer_id 
FROM users 
WHERE email = 'role1@scratchie.com';
```

## Success Criteria

âœ… Super Admins can see all companies' data
âœ… Super Admins can filter by specific company
âœ… Company users see ONLY their own data
âœ… Company users CANNOT see other companies' data
âœ… Frontend shows incidents based on user role
