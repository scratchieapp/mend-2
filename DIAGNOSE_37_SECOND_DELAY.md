# Diagnosing the 37-Second Delay

## Current Situation
- Database query: 8-18ms ✅
- Frontend still shows: 37,959ms ❌
- PerformanceMonitor fix didn't help

## Key Observations
1. The console shows `[RPC] get_dashboard_data:start` and `:end` timestamps
2. The time between these is ~38 seconds
3. This timing is from the hook itself, NOT the PerformanceMonitor

## Hypothesis
The delay is happening INSIDE the supabase.rpc() call itself, possibly due to:
1. **Supabase client configuration issues** (auth refresh, session management)
2. **Network timeouts or retries**
3. **CORS or authentication delays**
4. **The actual Supabase server taking that long** (unlikely given our DB tests)

## Next Steps
1. Enable VITE_DIRECT_RPC=true to bypass supabase client
2. Check Supabase client configuration
3. Look for retry logic in the supabase client

## The Real Issue
Looking at the Supabase client configuration:
```javascript
export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {
  auth: {
    autoRefreshToken: false,
    persistSession: false,
    detectSessionInUrl: false,
  },
});
```

This SHOULD be lean, but something in the RPC call is still causing delays.
