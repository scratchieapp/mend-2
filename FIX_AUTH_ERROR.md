# Fix: "No authenticated user" Error

## The Problem

When you ran:
```javascript
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
```

You cleared your **authentication session**! This includes:
- Clerk authentication tokens
- Supabase session
- User context

## Why This Happens

The `set_employer_context` function in Supabase requires `auth.uid()` to identify the user. When you clear storage, you're logged out!

## The Solution

### Option 1: Selective Clearing (Recommended)
Instead of clearing everything, only clear employer-related data:

```javascript
// Only clear employer selection, not auth
localStorage.removeItem("selectedEmployerId");
location.reload();
```

### Option 2: Clear and Re-login
If you must clear everything:

```javascript
// Clear everything
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
// Then reload to force re-login
location.reload();
// You'll need to log in again
```

### Option 3: Clear Everything Except Auth
```javascript
// Save auth tokens
const clerkAuth = localStorage.getItem('__clerk_db_jwt');
const supabaseAuth = localStorage.getItem('supabase.auth.token');

// Clear everything
localStorage.clear();

// Restore auth
if (clerkAuth) localStorage.setItem('__clerk_db_jwt', clerkAuth);
if (supabaseAuth) localStorage.setItem('supabase.auth.token', supabaseAuth);

// Reload
location.reload();
```

## For Testing Employer Selection

Just use this:
```javascript
// Test employer selection without breaking auth
localStorage.setItem("selectedEmployerId", "8"); // Newcastle Builders
location.reload();

// Or for View All
localStorage.setItem("selectedEmployerId", "null");
location.reload();
```

## The Many Token Requests

All those `tokens?` requests in the network tab are Clerk trying to refresh your authentication after you cleared it. This is causing additional load.

## Summary

✅ The dashboard performance fixes are working  
✅ Employer selection code is correct  
❌ You just need to stay logged in to test it!

Don't clear your auth session when testing!
