## üß™ Testing Steps

### Authentication Flow

1. **Initial Load**
   - [ ] Navigate to application root
   - [ ] Should redirect to `/auth/clerk-login` if not authenticated
   - [ ] Should show Clerk login form

2. **Login Process**
   - [ ] Enter demo credentials (e.g., `role1@scratchie.com`)
   - [ ] Should authenticate successfully
   - [ ] Should redirect to role-specific dashboard
   - [ ] Should sync user data with Supabase

3. **User Badge Display**
   - [ ] UserBadge should appear in top-right of MenuBar
   - [ ] Should show user avatar/initials
   - [ ] Should display name and role badge
   - [ ] Dropdown should show full user details

4. **Logout Process**
   - [ ] Click user badge ‚Üí Sign Out
   - [ ] Should log out successfully
   - [ ] Should redirect to `/auth/clerk-login`
   - [ ] Should clear all session data

### Role-Based Access Control

Test with each demo account:

#### Super Admin (role1@scratchie.com)
- [ ] Should redirect to `/admin` on login
- [ ] Should access all admin routes
- [ ] Should see all company data
- [ ] Should manage all users

#### Account Manager (role2@scratchie.com)
- [ ] Should redirect to `/account-manager` on login
- [ ] Should access account management features
- [ ] Should see only assigned company data

#### Data Entry (role3@scratchie.com)
- [ ] Should redirect to `/dashboard` on login
- [ ] Should access data entry features
- [ ] Should see only assigned company data

#### Builder Admin (role5@scratchie.com)
- [ ] Should redirect to `/builder-senior` on login
- [ ] Should access builder dashboard
- [ ] Should see builder-specific features
- [ ] Should manage builder sites

### Company Data Filtering

1. **Incidents View**
   - [ ] Non-admin users see only their company's incidents
   - [ ] Admins see all incidents
   - [ ] Medical professionals see all incidents

2. **Sites View**
   - [ ] Users see only their company's sites
   - [ ] Site admins see their assigned site
   - [ ] Admins see all sites

3. **Workers View**
   - [ ] Users see only their company's workers
   - [ ] Admins see all workers

### Map Functionality

1. **Mapbox Map**
   - [ ] Map should render on builder dashboard
   - [ ] Should show site markers
   - [ ] Should handle click events
   - [ ] Should use correct access token

### Protected Routes

1. **Unauthorized Access**
   - [ ] Direct navigation to protected route redirects to login
   - [ ] Wrong role accessing restricted route shows unauthorized
   - [ ] Session expiry redirects to login

2. **Development Routes**
   - [ ] `/dev/incident-report` accessible without auth
   - [ ] Other dev routes work as expected

## üêõ Known Issues to Monitor

1. **Session Management**
   - Clerk session might conflict with Supabase session
   - Monitor for any white screen issues
   - Check for redirect loops

2. **Data Sync**
   - User creation in Supabase on first Clerk login
   - Role assignment based on email
   - Employer ID assignment

3. **Performance**
   - RLS policies might slow down queries
   - Monitor query performance
   - Check for N+1 query issues

## üìù Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if environment variables are set
grep VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY .env
grep VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN .env
grep VITE_SUPABASE_URL .env

# Verify Clerk is installed
npm list @clerk/clerk-react

# Verify Mapbox is installed
npm list mapbox-gl

# Check TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run linter
npm run lint
```

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

1. [ ] Run RLS migration on production database
2. [ ] Set production environment variables
3. [ ] Configure Clerk production keys
4. [ ] Test with production-like data
5. [ ] Verify all role mappings
6. [ ] Test company filtering thoroughly
7. [ ] Load test with multiple concurrent users
8. [ ] Set up monitoring for auth failures
