# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIX: Incidents Should Load Now!

## The Problem Found
`useUserContext` was making ANOTHER database query for user info, causing:
- If the query was slow â†’ `roleId` = null
- If `roleId` = null â†’ incidents query is **DISABLED**
- Result: Spinner forever, no data loads

## The Fix
âœ… Eliminated the duplicate query  
âœ… Use existing `userData` from `AuthContext`  
âœ… This ensures `roleId` is available immediately

## What Should Happen Now (after deploy)

1. Select "Newcastle Builders" 
2. Spinner shows briefly (< 1 second)
3. **Data loads!** Shows 12 incidents for Newcastle Builders

## If It Still Doesn't Work

Check Console for:
- Any errors about `roleId` being null
- Network tab: Is `get_dashboard_data` request made?
- Is the request completing or hanging?

## Next Performance Fix

Still have 8-second initial load due to:
- AuthContext query: ~700ms
- UserBadge query: ~700ms  
- Multiple employer queries: ~700ms each
- Total: 4-5 duplicate queries = 8+ seconds

But at least employer selection should work now! ðŸŽ‰
