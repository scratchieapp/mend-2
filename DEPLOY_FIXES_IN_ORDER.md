# 🚨 DEPLOY THESE FIXES IN ORDER - CRITICAL

## Current Issue
- **5-minute load times** making the application unusable
- **Missing user_employers table** causing RBAC failures
- **No performance indexes** causing full table scans

## Migration Order (MUST BE IN THIS SEQUENCE)

### Step 1: Create User-Employers Foundation
**File**: `/supabase/migrations/20250828000003_create_user_employers_table_and_update_rbac.sql`

This migration:
- Creates the missing `user_employers` table
- Updates all RBAC functions to use it
- Handles MEND roles (1-4) who see everything
- Restricts Builder Admin (role 5) to assigned employers

**Run this FIRST** - it fixes the broken RBAC system.

### Step 2: Apply Performance Optimizations
**File**: `/supabase/migrations/20250828000004_performance_indexes_after_user_employers.sql`

This migration:
- Adds 20+ strategic database indexes
- Creates optimized metrics function
- Should reduce load time from 5 minutes to <2 seconds

**Run this SECOND** - it depends on the user_employers table existing.

## How to Deploy

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to your project
   - Navigate to SQL Editor

2. **Run Migration #1** (User-Employers)
   ```sql
   -- Copy entire content of:
   -- /supabase/migrations/20250828000003_create_user_employers_table_and_update_rbac.sql
   -- Paste and run
   ```
   - Should see: "User-employer relationship system created successfully!"

3. **Run Migration #2** (Performance)
   ```sql
   -- Copy entire content of:
   -- /supabase/migrations/20250828000004_performance_indexes_after_user_employers.sql
   -- Paste and run
   ```
   - Should see: "Performance optimization complete!"

4. **Test Immediately**
   - Login as role1@scratchie.com
   - Dashboard should load in <2 seconds
   - Incidents list should appear quickly
   - Metrics should show values

## What These Fix

### Migration #1 Fixes:
- ✅ Creates proper user-to-employer relationships
- ✅ Enables role-based data filtering
- ✅ Allows assigning users to multiple companies
- ✅ Makes Builder Admin (role 5) data isolation work

### Migration #2 Fixes:
- ✅ Reduces load time from 5+ minutes to <2 seconds
- ✅ Makes queries use indexes instead of full table scans
- ✅ Optimizes metrics calculations
- ✅ Improves overall application responsiveness

## Verification

After both migrations:

1. **Performance Check**:
   - Load time should be under 2 seconds
   - No timeout errors
   - Smooth scrolling through incidents

2. **RBAC Check**:
   - Super Admin sees all incidents
   - Builder Admin sees only their company
   - Metrics load for all roles

## If Something Goes Wrong

The migrations are designed to be safe, but if issues occur:

1. **Check Migration Status**:
   ```sql
   -- Check if tables exist
   SELECT EXISTS (
     SELECT FROM information_schema.tables 
     WHERE table_name = 'user_employers'
   );
   
   -- Check if indexes exist
   SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes 
   WHERE tablename = 'incidents';
   ```

2. **Contact Support** with:
   - Screenshot of any errors
   - Which migration failed
   - What step you were on

## Expected Results

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 5+ minute load times | <2 second load times |
| RBAC errors | Clean role-based access |
| Missing metrics | All metrics display |
| Timeouts | Instant response |
