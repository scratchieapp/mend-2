## üö® CRITICAL PERFORMANCE FIX REQUIRED (Updated: 2025-08-26)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:
**The application has severe performance issues causing browser crashes. A fix has been created but needs to be applied:**

1. **DATABASE FIX REQUIRED**: Execute `/scripts/EXECUTE_NOW_critical_fix.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **See `/CRITICAL_DATABASE_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed instructions**

### Issues Identified and Fixed in Code:
- ‚úÖ React query infinite loops eliminated
- ‚úÖ Redundant data fetching removed
- ‚úÖ Query invalidation cascade optimized
- ‚úÖ Debouncing added to prevent rapid updates
- ‚úÖ Cache times increased, window focus refetch disabled
- ‚ùå Database function still broken until SQL fix is applied

## Current Status (Updated: 2025-08-26 - PERFORMANCE ISSUES RESOLVED IN CODE, DATABASE FIX PENDING)

### ‚úÖ AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM OPERATIONAL (2025-08-25)
**SUCCESS: Authentication and role-based routing is working with Clerk**

### ‚úÖ DATA RETRIEVAL ISSUES RESOLVED (2025-08-26)
**FIXED: All dashboard data now displays correctly with proper filtering**
- **Recent Incidents**: Fixed date range filtering to show all incidents in selected month
- **Open Claims**: Now using actual incident data (workers not returned to work)
- **Claim Costs**: Calculating real costs based on incident classifications
- **Average Days Lost**: Properly filtering by employer and date range
- **Psychosocial Flags**: New component analyzing incidents for mental health indicators

### ‚úÖ SUPER ADMIN FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETE (2025-08-26)
**SUCCESS: Comprehensive admin capabilities for MEND Super Admin (role 1)**
- **Builder/Employer Management**: Create, edit, and delete construction companies
- **Enhanced User Management**: Assign users to companies with role-based access
- **RLS Testing Panel**: Verify data isolation for each employer
- **Company Assignment**: Users can be assigned to specific employers for data access control

## ‚úÖ AUTHENTICATION STATUS (August 25, 2025)

### 1. **Authentication Working with Clerk** ‚úÖ
   - **Status**: Clerk authentication is fully functional
   - **Login Flow**: Users can successfully authenticate
   - **Session Management**: Proper session handling throughout app
   - **Impact**: Core authentication system operational

### 2. **Role-Based Routing Functional** ‚úÖ
   - **Test Results**: All role routing working correctly
   - **Verified**: role_id 1 ‚Üí /admin dashboard ‚úÖ

### 2. **Frontend Fixes Applied** ‚úÖ
   - **IncidentsList**: Now properly uses selectedEmployerId for filtering
   - **Dashboard Routing**: Role 1 users now go to /dashboard (with incidents)
   - **Employer Selection**: Works correctly with dropdown filter
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Frontend ready to work

### 3. **Data Display Issues Fixed** ‚úÖ
   - **SafetySummary**: Fixed to show all incidents in month (not just first day)
   - **OpenClaimsCard**: Now shows actual open incidents from database
   - **InsurancePremiumCard**: Calculates real costs based on incident severity
   - **AverageDaysLostCard**: Properly filters by employer and date range
