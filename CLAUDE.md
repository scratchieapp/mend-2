- **Error Handling**: ‚úÖ Proper error messages
- **Keyboard Navigation**: ‚úÖ Tab navigation functional
- **Mobile Responsive**: ‚úÖ Renders on mobile viewport

## Critical Issues to Address Before Production

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY (Security)
1. **File Upload Security**
   - Insufficient file name sanitization (path traversal risk)
   - No virus scanning implementation
   - Missing access control validation
   - Fix: Implement UUID-based naming, add content validation

2. **TypeScript Type Safety**
   - 58 instances of `any` types
   - Fix: Create proper interfaces, enable strict mode

3. **Input Sanitization**
   - Direct database queries without sanitization
   - Fix: Add input validation layer

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY (Stability)
1. **Memory Leaks**
   - Error logger accumulates without cleanup
   - Session storage keys never cleared
   - Fix: Implement proper cleanup routines

2. **Race Conditions**
   - Authentication state updates
   - Session refresh conflicts
   - Fix: Add mutex patterns for critical sections

3. **Validation Inconsistency**
   - Multiple validation schemas for same data
   - Fix: Consolidate to single source of truth

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY (Enhancement)
1. **Test Coverage**
   - No automated tests
   - Fix: Add Jest, React Testing Library

2. **Performance**
   - Large bundle size (1.1MB)
   - Fix: Implement code splitting

3. **Accessibility**
   - Missing ARIA labels
   - Fix: Add proper accessibility attributes

## Migration Instructions
Run the corrected migration:
```sql
/supabase/migrations/20240101000001_incident_documents_fixed.sql
```

## Environment Variables Required
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Next Steps for Production Deployment

2. Secure file upload implementation
3. Add input sanitization
4. Fix memory leaks

### Short Term (1 week)
1. Implement automated testing
2. Add proper error codes
3. Enhance form autosave
4. Add loading skeletons

### Long Term (2-4 weeks)
1. Implement email service integration (SendGrid/AWS SES)
2. Add SMS notifications (Twilio)
3. Performance optimization
4. Complete accessibility audit

## Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit

# Linting
npm run lint

# Start Supabase locally (if configured)
npx supabase start
```

## Key Files and Locations
- **Authentication**: `/src/lib/auth/AuthContext.tsx`
- **Role Management**: `/src/lib/auth/roles.ts`
- **Incident Report Form**: `/src/pages/IncidentReport.tsx`
- **File Upload**: `/src/components/FileUpload.tsx`
- **Error Handling**: `/src/lib/monitoring/errorLogger.ts`
- **Admin Dashboard**: `/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`
- **Database Types**: `/src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`
- **Migrations**: `/supabase/migrations/`

## Documentation and MCP servers generally
- There is a Context7 MCP server, so make sure to use that whenever you need documentation from something.
- The Supabase MCP is crucial for interacting with the database. If anything is not connected or not working, then you need to let me know so I can fix that.There is a specialist sub-agent for Supabase.
- Use Playwright for any testing.
- There is also a Vercel MCP, so you can check out the logs if any builds are failing.And just anything else with regards to deployment.

## Architecture Decisions
1. **Supabase over custom backend**: Faster development, built-in auth
2. **shadcn/ui components**: Consistent, accessible, customizable
3. **Zod validation**: Type-safe runtime validation
4. **React Query**: Efficient server state management
5. **Error boundaries**: Graceful error recovery

## Known Limitations
1. Notifications are placeholders (no actual email/SMS sending)
2. No automated test coverage
3. Bundle size needs optimization
4. Some accessibility features missing
5. No offline support

## Contact and Support
This is an internal workplace safety management system. For issues or questions:
- Review migration instructions in `/MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- Check UI/UX recommendations in `.claude/doc/ui-ux-analysis-recommendations.md`
- Ensure all environment variables are configured

## Risk Assessment
**Current Risk Level: MEDIUM**
- Application is functionally complete
- Security vulnerabilities need addressing
- Code quality issues impact maintainability
- No critical runtime bugs identified

## EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Code Quality Checks
**Always run the following commands before completing any task.**

1. Automatically use the IDE's built-in diagnostics tool to check for linting and type errors:
- You can use the error checking sub-agent
- If Code Rabbit is available, then use that.
- Do this for every file that you create or modify.

This is a critical step that must never be skipped when working on any code-related task.

## Recommendation
The application is ready for **staging deployment** and user acceptance testing, but requires the high-priority security fixes before production deployment. Estimated time to production-ready: 3-5 days of focused development.
