## ‚ö†Ô∏è FIXES ATTEMPTED - AWAITING VERIFICATION (2025-01-10)

### üîß CODE CHANGES APPLIED (NOT YET TESTED)
- **Memory Leak**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **CODE APPLIED** - Cache cleanup implemented but Chrome crashes NOT YET RESOLVED
- **Employer Switching**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **CODE APPLIED** - Invalidation logic updated but auto-refresh NOT YET TESTED
- **RLS Security**: ‚úÖ **FIXED & VERIFIED** - Security vulnerability patched and applied to database
- **Builder Admin Setup**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - role5@scratchie.com assigned to Newcastle Builders (employer_id=8)

### üîí CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY - FIXED & APPLIED ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Builder Admins could bypass RLS and access OTHER employers' data by manipulating the `filter_employer_id` parameter.

**Evidence**: role5 (Builder Admin for employer_id=8) could request employer_id=1 data and receive 26 incidents from the wrong company!

**Fix**: Database function `get_dashboard_data` now IGNORES `filter_employer_id` for non-super-admin roles and enforces `user_employer_id`.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED TO DATABASE**
- Migration executed: `/supabase/migrations/20250110_fix_rls_security_vulnerability.sql`
- Database function now enforces proper RLS boundaries
- Builder Admins can no longer bypass security by manipulating parameters

### üîß CODE CHANGES APPLIED (AWAITING USER TESTING)

#### 1. Memory Leak - CODE APPLIED, NOT YET VERIFIED ‚ö†Ô∏è
**File**: `/apps/operations/src/main.tsx`
- Increased `gcTime` from 30s to 5 minutes (prevents premature cache disposal)
- Aggressive cache cleanup every 30 seconds (removes stale queries)
- Nuclear cleanup every 3 minutes (clears >30% inactive queries)
- Memory monitoring in development mode
- Re-enabled `structuralSharing` for better memory efficiency

**File**: `/apps/operations/src/hooks/useIncidentsDashboard.ts`
- Aligned `staleTime` and `gcTime` with global config
- Proper abort controller cleanup on unmount
- Query invalidation on employer changes

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è User has NOT yet tested if Chrome still crashes after 5 minutes

#### 2. Employer Switching Auto-Refresh - CODE APPLIED, NOT YET TESTED ‚ö†Ô∏è
**File**: `/apps/operations/src/hooks/useEmployerSelection.ts`
- Cancel all pending queries BEFORE state update
- Remove old employer queries completely (prevent stale data)
- Update state, then force refetch with new context
- Added error rollback mechanism
- Development logging for debugging

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è User has NOT yet verified if dashboard auto-refreshes when switching employers

#### 3. Builder Admin Configuration - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
**Database Changes**:
- role5@scratchie.com updated: employer_id changed from 1 to 8 (Newcastle Builders Pty Ltd)
- user_employers table synchronized with new assignment
- Ready for isolation testing after other fixes are verified

### ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT: USER TESTING REQUIRED
- [ ] **Test Memory Stability** - Use dashboard for 15+ minutes to verify Chrome no longer crashes
- [ ] **Test Employer Switching** - Verify dashboard auto-refreshes when selecting different employer
- [ ] **Test Builder Admin Isolation** - Login as role5@scratchie.com and verify only Newcastle Builders data visible
- [ ] **Verify No Regression** - Confirm existing features still work after code changes
