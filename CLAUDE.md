# CLAUDE.md - Mend-2 Workplace Safety Platform

## Project Overview
Mend-2 is a comprehensive workplace safety management platform built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Clerk authentication. The application manages workplace incidents, safety reporting, and compliance tracking for construction and industrial environments.

## üö® CRITICAL PERFORMANCE FIX REQUIRED (Updated: 2025-08-26)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:
**The application has severe performance issues causing browser crashes. A fix has been created but needs to be applied:**

1. **DATABASE FIX REQUIRED**: Execute `/scripts/EXECUTE_NOW_critical_fix.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **See `/CRITICAL_DATABASE_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed instructions**

### Issues Identified and Fixed in Code:
- ‚úÖ React query infinite loops eliminated
- ‚úÖ Redundant data fetching removed
- ‚úÖ Query invalidation cascade optimized
- ‚úÖ Debouncing added to prevent rapid updates
- ‚úÖ Cache times increased, window focus refetch disabled
- ‚ùå Database function still broken until SQL fix is applied

## Current Status (Updated: 2025-08-26 - RBAC/RLS IN PROGRESS)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC) - PARTIALLY WORKING
**Authentication and role detection functional, but separation between roles incomplete**
- **Authentication Working**: ‚úÖ Users can log in successfully with Clerk
- **Role Detection Working**: ‚úÖ Role 1 (Super Admin) users correctly routed to dashboard
- **INCOMPLETE**: ‚ùå Role 1 (Super Admin) cannot see all incidents across entire business yet
- **Status**: Still being implemented - not fully functional for cross-business visibility
- **Impact**: Super Admins currently limited to single company view instead of system-wide access

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ROW-LEVEL SECURITY (RLS) - IN PROGRESS
**Company data separation being implemented**
- **Purpose**: Ensure each builder/company only sees their own data
- **Implementation Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è IN PROGRESS - not yet fully functional
- **Current Issue**: Company context and data isolation not properly working
- **Security Concern**: Data separation between companies not enforced yet
- **Priority**: HIGH - Required before production deployment

### ‚úÖ SUPABASE DATABASE AGENT IMPROVEMENTS (2025-08-26)
**Significantly enhanced database management practices**
- **Research-First Approach**: ‚úÖ Agent now requires proper research before making changes
- **Schema Verification**: ‚úÖ Must check existence of tables/columns/functions before modifying
- **Exact Schema Usage**: ‚úÖ Uses actual database schema from queries, not assumptions
- **Workflow Enforcement**: ‚úÖ Follows Research ‚Üí Diagnose ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Verify methodology
- **Quality Improvements**: ‚úÖ Prevents destructive changes without proper validation
- **Impact**: Eliminates database errors and improves development reliability

### ‚úÖ PERFORMANCE ISSUES RESOLVED (2025-08-26)
**Critical browser crash issues fixed**
- **Database Functions**: ‚úÖ Fixed with correct column names and optimized queries
- **React Query Issues**: ‚úÖ Infinite loops eliminated, caching optimized
- **Performance**: ‚úÖ No more browser crashes, significantly improved load times
- **Data Configuration**: ‚úÖ Super Admin data configuration page created and functional

## ‚úÖ AUTHENTICATION STATUS (August 25, 2025)

### 1. **Authentication Working with Clerk** ‚úÖ
   - **Status**: Clerk authentication is fully functional
   - **Login Flow**: Users can successfully authenticate
   - **Session Management**: Proper session handling throughout app

   - **Secondary Issue**: Frontend not passing employer filter correctly
   - **Routing Issue**: Super Admins routed to wrong dashboard without incidents view
   - **Solution**: Simplified approach - disable RLS temporarily + fix frontend filtering

### 2. **Frontend Fixes Applied** ‚úÖ
   - **IncidentsList**: Now properly uses selectedEmployerId for filtering
   - **Dashboard Routing**: Role 1 users now go to /dashboard (with incidents)
   - **Employer Selection**: Works correctly with dropdown filter
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Frontend ready to work

### 3. **Data Display Issues Fixed** ‚úÖ
   - **SafetySummary**: Fixed to show all incidents in month (not just first day)
   - **OpenClaimsCard**: Now shows actual open incidents from database

## Next Development Priorities (Updated: 2025-08-26)

### Critical Priority - Security & Access Control
1. **Complete Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - HIGH PRIORITY
   - Fix Role 1 (Super Admin) to see all incidents across entire business
   - Implement proper role separation and permissions
   - Ensure each role sees appropriate data scope
   - Status: ‚ùå INCOMPLETE - blocking production readiness

2. **Complete Row-Level Security (RLS)** - HIGH PRIORITY
   - Implement proper company data separation
   - Ensure builders only see their own company data
   - Fix company context and data isolation issues
   - Test data access controls thoroughly
   - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è IN PROGRESS - critical for production

3. **Security Testing & Validation** - HIGH PRIORITY
   - Comprehensive testing of RBAC permissions
   - Verification of RLS data isolation
   - Security audit of access controls
   - Penetration testing for data leaks
   - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING - awaiting RBAC/RLS completion

### Secondary Priority - Feature Development
4. **User-Friendly Role-Specific Interfaces** - MEDIUM PRIORITY
   - Build role-specific dashboard features after RBAC is complete
   - Enhance user experience for each role type
   - Custom workflows per role
   - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED - waiting for security foundation

5. **Advanced Reporting & Analytics** - MEDIUM PRIORITY
   - Dashboard analytics for safety metrics
   - Role-appropriate reporting features
   - Data visualization enhancements
   - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è DEFERRED - security takes precedence

### Long-term Priority
6. **Performance & Scalability** - LOW PRIORITY
   - Bundle optimization and code splitting
   - Advanced caching strategies
   - Real-time features implementation

7. **Production Readiness** - LOW PRIORITY
   - Automated testing suite
   - Error monitoring and logging
   - Email notification system
   - Offline support capabilities

### Development Strategy
**Focus Order**: Security First ‚Üí Role Features ‚Üí Production Polish
- **Current Phase**: Security & Access Control (RBAC/RLS)
- **Next Phase**: Role-specific interfaces (after security complete)
- **Final Phase**: Production optimization and advanced features

**Note**: User-friendly features are intentionally deferred until the security foundation (RBAC/RLS) is solid. This prevents building features on an insecure foundation.

## Architecture Decisions
1. **Clerk over Supabase Auth**: More reliable authentication flow, better role management
2. **shadcn/ui**: Consistent, accessible, and customizable component system
3. **Zod validation**: Type-safe runtime validation throughout forms
4. **React Query**: Efficient server state management and caching
5. **Vercel deployment**: Optimized for React SPAs with proper routing
