   - Role-based permissions and access control
   - User profile management

4. **UI/UX**
   - shadcn/ui component library
   - Responsive design
   - Clean, professional interface
   - Loading states and error handling

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18.3, TypeScript, Vite
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS
- **Forms**: React Hook Form, Zod validation
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Demo Users
The application includes 9 demo users for testing different role levels:
- **Email**: role1@scratchie.com through role9@scratchie.com
- **Password**: DemoUser123!
- **Roles**: 1 (lowest privileges) through 9 (highest privileges)

## Database Schema
- **incidents**: Core incident records with proper field mapping
- **users**: User accounts with Clerk integration
- **user_roles**: Role-based access control (1-9)
- **incident_documents**: File attachments for incidents
- **notifications**: System notification records

## Environment Variables
```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Recent Critical Fixes

### Authentication Loop Resolution (Aug 22, 2025)
- **Issue**: Users experiencing infinite redirect loops on login
- **Root Cause**: Conflicting authentication state management
- **Solution**: Consolidated to Clerk-only authentication flow
- **Status**: âœ… RESOLVED - Clean authentication flow restored

### Database Field Mapping
- **Issue**: User ID field mapping between Clerk and Supabase
- **Solution**: Updated schema to use `clerk_user_id` field
- **Enhancement**: Added Australian phone number formatting
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETE

## Known Issues & Monitoring

### Performance
- **Bundle Size**: ~1.2MB (warning threshold)
- **Load Time**: Acceptable for current user base
- **Recommendation**: Consider code splitting for future optimization

### Browser Compatibility
- âœ… Chrome, Firefox, Safari (latest versions)
- âœ… Mobile responsive design
- âœ… Keyboard navigation support

## Development Commands
```bash
# Development server
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Development build (for testing)
npm run build:dev

# Linting
npm run lint

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Create demo users (one-time setup)
npm run create-demo-users
```

## Key File Locations
- **Main App**: `/src/App.tsx`
- **Authentication**: `/src/lib/auth/` (Clerk integration)
- **Incident Report**: `/src/pages/IncidentReport.tsx`
- **Database Types**: `/src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`
- **Components**: `/src/components/` (shadcn/ui based)
- **Routing**: Configured in App.tsx with protected routes

## Deployment Information
- **Platform**: Vercel
- **URL**: [Your deployed URL]
- **Build Status**: âœ… Successful
- **Last Deploy**: 2025-08-22 (authentication fix)

## Next Development Priorities

### High Priority
1. **Bundle Optimization** - Implement code splitting to reduce initial load
2. **Error Monitoring** - Add production error tracking
3. **Performance Metrics** - Implement user experience monitoring

### Medium Priority
1. **Automated Testing** - Add unit and integration tests
2. **Email Notifications** - Integrate email service for incident alerts
3. **Advanced Reporting** - Dashboard analytics for safety metrics

### Low Priority
1. **Offline Support** - PWA capabilities for field use
2. **Mobile App** - Native mobile application consideration
3. **API Documentation** - Comprehensive API documentation

## Architecture Decisions
1. **Clerk over Supabase Auth**: More reliable authentication flow, better role management
2. **shadcn/ui**: Consistent, accessible, and customizable component system
3. **Zod validation**: Type-safe runtime validation throughout forms
4. **React Query**: Efficient server state management and caching
5. **Vercel deployment**: Optimized for React SPAs with proper routing

## Risk Assessment
**Current Risk Level: LOW**
- âœ… Authentication system stable and tested
- âœ… Database integration working correctly
- âœ… Deployment pipeline functional
- âœ… No critical security vulnerabilities identified
- âœ… User acceptance testing ready

## Quality Metrics
