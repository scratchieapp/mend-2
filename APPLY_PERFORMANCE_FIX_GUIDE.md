# 🚨 CRITICAL PERFORMANCE FIX - APPLY IMMEDIATELY

## Problem Identified
- **Issue**: Dashboard takes 5-10 minutes to load
- **Error**: `column i.total_claim_cost does not exist`
- **Root Cause**: Missing database function `get_incident_metrics_rbac` and wrong column reference

## Solution Overview
We've created two critical SQL scripts that will fix the performance issues:

1. **CRITICAL_PERFORMANCE_FIX_IMMEDIATE.sql** - Fixes the metrics function error
2. **OPTIMIZED_INCIDENTS_FUNCTION.sql** - Optimizes the incidents retrieval

## ⚡ Quick Application Steps

### Step 1: Apply Critical Metrics Fix (1 minute)
1. Open Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
2. Copy entire contents of `/CRITICAL_PERFORMANCE_FIX_IMMEDIATE.sql`
3. Paste and execute
4. You should see a successful result with metrics returned

### Step 2: Apply Incidents Optimization (1 minute)
1. In the same SQL Editor
2. Copy entire contents of `/OPTIMIZED_INCIDENTS_FUNCTION.sql`
3. Paste and execute
4. Functions will be created/updated successfully

### Step 3: Test Performance (30 seconds)
Run these test queries in the SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Test 1: Metrics function (should return instantly)
SELECT * FROM get_incident_metrics_rbac(1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

-- Test 2: Get Newcastle Builders employer_id
SELECT employer_id, employer_name 
FROM employers 
WHERE employer_name ILIKE '%Newcastle%';

-- Test 3: Test incidents retrieval for Newcastle Builders (replace X with actual ID)
SELECT * FROM get_incidents_with_details_rbac(
    50,     -- page_size
    0,      -- page_offset
    X,      -- filter_employer_id (use Newcastle Builders ID from Test 2)
    NULL,   -- filter_worker_id
    NULL,   -- filter_start_date
    NULL,   -- filter_end_date
    5,      -- user_role_id (Builder Admin)
    X       -- user_employer_id (same as filter_employer_id)
);
```

## ✅ Expected Results
- **Metrics Query**: < 0.1 seconds
- **Incidents Query**: < 0.5 seconds for 50 records
- **Dashboard Load**: < 1 second total

## 🎯 What These Fixes Do

### Fix 1: Metrics Function
- Creates the missing `get_incident_metrics_rbac` function
- Uses correct column name `estimated_cost` instead of `total_claim_cost`
- Properly calculates all metrics (LTI, MTI, FAI counts)
- Handles psychosocial factors correctly

### Fix 2: Incidents Optimization
- Optimized query execution with proper indexes
- Parallel query execution enabled
- Smart filtering order (most selective first)
- Proper NULL handling to avoid slow comparisons

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After applying both fixes:

1. **In your application**:
   - Login as any user
   - Dashboard should load in < 1 second
   - Metrics cards should display immediately
   - No console errors about `total_claim_cost`

2. **Test specific employer filtering**:
   - Select "Newcastle Builders" from employer dropdown
   - Results should appear instantly
   - No timeout or long wait

3. **Check browser console**:
   - No errors about missing columns
   - No timeout errors
   - Metrics load successfully

## ⚠️ If Issues Persist

If you still experience slow performance after applying these fixes:

1. **Check indexes exist**:
```sql
SELECT indexname, indexdef 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename = 'incidents' 
ORDER BY indexname;
```

2. **Analyze table statistics**:
```sql
ANALYZE incidents;
ANALYZE employers;
ANALYZE workers;
ANALYZE sites;
```

3. **Check function exists**:
```sql
SELECT proname 
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname LIKE '%incident%metrics%';
```
