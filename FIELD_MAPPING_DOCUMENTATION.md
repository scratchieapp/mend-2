5. **medical_professionals** - Doctors and medical staff

### Lookup Tables
- body_parts
- body_sides
- departments
- mechanism_of_injury_codes
- nature_of_injury_codes

## Transformation Process

The transformation service (`transformation.ts`) handles:

1. **Entity Creation/Lookup**:
   - Creates new employers, sites, or workers if they don't exist
   - Returns existing IDs if entities are found
   - Updates related information (e.g., supervisor details on sites)

2. **Field Mapping**:
   - Maps form field names to correct database columns
   - Handles alternative field names (e.g., mend_client â†’ employer)
   - Manages foreign key relationships

3. **Data Type Conversion**:
   - Converts string IDs to integers
   - Parses mechanism of injury codes (format: "main-sub")
   - Handles boolean conversions

4. **Validation**:
   - Ensures required fields are present
   - Validates foreign key references
   - Provides specific error messages

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Form data from UI
const formData = {
  mend_client: "ABC Construction",
  worker_name: "John Smith",
  site_name: "Downtown Project",
  supervisor_contact: "Jane Doe",
  supervisor_phone: "555-0123",
  employment_type: "full-time",
  body_side: "1", // Left
  type_of_first_aid: "First Aid Only",
  referred_to: "Medical Center",
  actions_taken: "Provided first aid, notified supervisor",
  case_notes: "Worker slipped on wet surface",
  notifying_person_name: "Bob Manager",
  notifying_person_position: "Site Supervisor",
  notifying_person_telephone: "555-4567"
};

// Transformed for database
const dbData = {
  employer_id: 123, // Created/looked up
  worker_id: 456, // Created/looked up
  site_id: 789, // Created/looked up
  body_side_id: 1,
  treatment_provided: "First Aid Only",
  referral: "Medical Center",
  actions: "Provided first aid, notified supervisor",
  case_notes: "Worker slipped on wet surface",
  notifying_person_name: "Bob Manager",
  notifying_person_position: "Site Supervisor",
  notifying_person_telephone: "555-4567"
};
```

## Important Notes

1. **Employers ARE mend_clients** - These terms are used interchangeably
2. **Supervisor information** is stored on the sites table, not incidents
3. **Employment type** is stored on the workers table, not incidents
4. **Notifying person** fields are stored directly in the incidents table
5. **All lookup values** should be sent as IDs, not text values
6. **The transformation service** handles creating missing entities automatically

## Error Handling

Common errors and their meanings:
- **23502**: Required field is missing
- **23503**: Invalid foreign key reference
- **23505**: Duplicate entry (already exists)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Employer creation/lookup works
- [ ] Site creation/lookup works with supervisor info
- [ ] Worker creation/lookup works with employment type
- [ ] All lookup table IDs are properly converted
- [ ] Notifying person fields are saved correctly
- [ ] Treatment and referral fields are mapped
- [ ] Actions and case notes are preserved
- [ ] Form submission completes successfully
