# Fix for 10-Second Dashboard Delay (Updated)

## The Real Problem Found!

The current `useEmployerSelection` hook is doing `window.location.reload()` when changing employers! This causes:
- Full page reload (10+ seconds)
- Loss of all React state
- Unnecessary network requests
- Poor user experience

## Apply The Fix

### Step 1: Replace the employer selection hook

```bash
cd /Users/jameskell/Cursor/mend-2

# Backup the current problematic version
cp apps/operations/src/hooks/useEmployerSelection.ts apps/operations/src/hooks/useEmployerSelection.ts.bak2

# Replace with the optimized version
cp apps/operations/src/hooks/useEmployerSelectionOptimized.ts apps/operations/src/hooks/useEmployerSelection.ts
```

### Step 2: Update IncidentsListOptimized.tsx

Edit `/Users/jameskell/Cursor/mend-2/apps/operations/src/components/dashboard/IncidentsListOptimized.tsx`:

```typescript
// Change this line at the top:
// import { useIncidentsUltraOptimized } from '@/hooks/useIncidentsUltraOptimized';

// To this:
import { useIncidentsUltraOptimized } from '@/hooks/useIncidentsDashboardOptimized';
```

## What This Fixes

1. ✅ **No More Page Reloads** - Employer changes happen instantly
2. ✅ **Targeted Query Invalidation** - Only refreshes relevant data
3. ✅ **Single Database Call** - Combined function reduces latency
4. ✅ **Better Caching** - Smarter cache management

## Expected Results

- **Before**: 10 seconds + full page reload
- **After**: < 500ms with smooth transitions
- **User Experience**: Instant employer switching

## Database Function Already Deployed

The `get_dashboard_data` function is already in your database, combining incidents and count queries into one.

## Test After Applying

1. Go to `/dashboard`
2. Switch between employers
3. Should be instant with no page reload
4. All data should update correctly
