# ‚úÖ Dashboard Fix Applied - Employer Context Error Resolved!

## What Was Fixed

1. **Function Not Found Error**: `set_employer_context_with_clerk` doesn't exist
   - Now using `set_employer_context(p_employer_id)`
   - Using `clear_employer_context()` for "View All" mode

2. **No Page Reloads**: Removed `window.location.reload()`
   - Employer switching is now instant
   - Only specific queries are invalidated

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Clear Browser Data**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   localStorage.clear()
   sessionStorage.clear()
   ```

2. **Hard Refresh**: Cmd+Shift+R

3. **Test Employer Switching**
   - Should work instantly now
   - No more console errors
   - "View All" should show all companies

## üìä Current Performance

- **Database**: 2-3ms ‚úÖ
- **Frontend**: 5-10 seconds ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üîç To Diagnose the 5-10 Second Delay

Open Network Tab (F12) and look for:

1. **Which RPC function is called?**
   - `get_dashboard_data` = GOOD (optimized)
   - `get_incidents_with_details_rbac` = OLD (slower)

2. **How long does the RPC call take?**
   - If < 1 second = frontend issue
   - If > 5 seconds = still using old function

3. **Multiple Calls?**
   - Should be ONE call to `get_dashboard_data`
   - Not two separate calls

## üí° If Still Slow

The 5-10 seconds might be from:
1. Not using the optimized hook (check imports)
2. JavaScript bundling/caching
3. React re-rendering issues

Try:
```bash
# Nuclear option - full rebuild
rm -rf node_modules .next dist
npm install
npm run build
```

## ‚úÖ What Should Work Now

- ‚úÖ View all employers as super admin
- ‚úÖ Switch between specific employers  
- ‚úÖ No more "function not found" errors
- ‚úÖ No page reloads on employer change

Let me know what you see in the Network tab!
